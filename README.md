# deep-learning-challenge

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, Iâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Steps:
- Preprocess the Data
- Compiled, trained, and evaluated the model
- Optimized the model
- Written a report on the Neural Network Model
